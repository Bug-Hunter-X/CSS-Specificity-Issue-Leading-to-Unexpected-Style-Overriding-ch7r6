The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#specific div {
  color: green;
}

#specific .special div {
  color: purple; /* This will override the other styles due to higher specificity */
}
```

This issue may not always be obvious if the developer is unaware of how CSS specificity works.  The `#specific .special div` selector has the highest specificity due to the use of an ID selector and a class selector in addition to the element selector. This high specificity ensures that `color: purple` overrides the other color definitions.
