The solution to this CSS specificity issue focuses on understanding and managing selector specificity.  Avoidance strategies include:

1. **Understanding Specificity:** Familiarize yourself with how CSS specificity works. ID selectors have the highest weight, followed by class selectors, and then element selectors.  Combining multiple selectors increases specificity.
2. **Using !important (Caution):** While `!important` can force a style to apply, it is generally discouraged as it can lead to difficult-to-maintain and unpredictable CSS. Use sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
3. **Refactoring:** Restructure your CSS to reduce the need for highly specific selectors by optimizing your HTML structure and/or adding more meaningful classes.
4. **CSS Preprocessors:** Use CSS preprocessors (like Sass or Less) to help manage complex styles and improve code organization. 

Here's an example of how to refactor the CSS to avoid the issue using better class naming conventions:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.specific {
  color: green;
}

.specific.special {
  color: purple;
}
```

This refactoring improves readability and maintainability while achieving the desired style outcome.
